# Touchscreen GUI for RetroPie
This project was inspired by "Nintimdo RP" project, which can be found [here](https://timee1994.weebly.com/nintimdo-rp.html).
I wanted to be able to be able to play games with both the physical buttons, and with touch controls. So I created this program (which is still *very* WIP) to allow touches to control RetroPie.
